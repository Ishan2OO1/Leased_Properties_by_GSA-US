# Analysis of the Inventory of Owned and Leased Properties (IOLP) Dataset

## Introduction
The **Inventory of Owned and Leased Properties (IOLP)** dataset provides comprehensive information about properties owned or leased by the General Services Administration (GSA). These properties are located across the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, and American Samoa. 

This dataset is an invaluable resource for understanding how government buildings and spaces are utilized, whether they are owned or rented. It includes detailed insights about property location, size, and condition.

## Data Overview

### Source
The dataset is provided by the **General Services Administration (GSA)**, a trusted and reliable source that manages government properties. This dataset is publicly available and ensures accuracy and reliability.

### Additional Data Integration
To enable advanced analysis, a **Population Density** dataset for the United States has been integrated. This allows us to explore leased properties in conjunction with the population density of specific areas, providing deeper insights into how government spaces align with population distribution.

## Project Goals
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the IOLP dataset.
- Identify trends and patterns in property usage, ownership, and leasing.
- Integrate population density data to find correlations between leased properties and regional population.
- Provide actionable visualizations and insights to aid decision-making.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Ensured data quality by handling missing values, standardizing formats, and merging datasets.
- **Advanced Analysis:** Combined IOLP and population density datasets to analyze leased properties relative to local population densities.
- **Visualization:** Used interactive and static visualizations to represent data insights effectively.
- **Insights and Recommendations:** Generated meaningful insights to understand property management in densely and sparsely populated areas.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Dataset Sources:**
  - [GSA Inventory of Owned and Leased Properties Dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/inventory-of-owned-and-leased-properties-iolp)
  - [US Population Density Data](https://www.census.gov/data.html)

## Results
- Identified the relationship between leased property distribution and regional population density.
- Highlighted high-density areas with significant leasing activity, suggesting optimal space utilization.
- Provided visualizations to communicate findings effectively.
